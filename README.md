# ProjectEulerPython

Python solutions for project euler problems... This is really for my personal benefit. If you are doing project Euler, don't ruin the problems for yourself by looking at my code.

If you've already solved a problem I have solved here go ahead!


## Reinventing the wheel

I do realize I re-implemented a lot of things that already have performant and feature-rich solutions like the python implementation of fraction or numpy's polynomial.
This is really just a learning exercise for me, so if I don't feel like something is sufficiently trivial, I will implement it myself as needed.
